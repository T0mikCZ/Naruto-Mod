# Naruto Mod

We aim to bring the Naruto anime into Rimworld, first by adding the visual prowess we see on the anime, such as sharingan, byakugan, etc.
Create new clans with different bonuses and abilities, the player will be able to choose his clan in the character creation.
Add the chakra nature (wind, fire, earth, etc) influencing the type of jutsus a character can use

# Currently in mod:

# Sharingan
Sharingan 1 - 3 tomoe
Mangekyo Sharingan
Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan
Ability to steal eyes from an uchiha and implant them to your self
Ability to gain sharingan if you are an uchiha
Gaining sharingan through an intense mental breakdown
Progressive sharingan leveling

# Misc
You can get several ninja ranks, ranging from genin to kage
Byakugan is in game, but you can't get it naturally
Rinnegan is in game, but not implemented
There is a chance when you are crating a character that you'll get a uchiha trait. That means you can get sharingan naturally

# Future Plans

We aim to make this mod quite big. First  completing the sharingan and adding several skills, like amaterasu, tsukuyomi...

# Visuals on the pawn
we aim to make sharingan or other dojutsus appear on the player when he gets it

# New Factions
factions like Hyugga or Uchiha
